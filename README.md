Breast Cancer Prediction is a classification task aimed at predicting the diagnosis of a breast mass as either malignant or benign. The dataset used for this prediction consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of the breast mass. These features describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei.
